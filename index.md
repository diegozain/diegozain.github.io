## My thing

I am interested in applying physics, mathematics and high performance computing for the betterment of humanity and exploration of reality. 

Previous interests include graph theory, error correcting codes, finite geometries and combinatorics. You can find that [here](https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1806&context=etds).

## Imaging the subsurface

High-resolution non-invasive electrical methods for imaging the shallow subsurface are beneficial for Humanity. They shed light on subsurface energy resources (i.e. oil, gas, geothermal), monitor CO2 sequestration sites and understand ground-water flow.

## Media coverage

[Here](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/boise-state-students-search-bodies-old-idaho-pen#stream/0) is a radio interview about finding graves at the [Old Idaho Penitentiary](https://history.idaho.gov/location/old-penitentiary/), which is also covered [here](https://www.boisestate.edu/news/2019/03/05/geophysics-club-works-to-help-solve-mysteries-in-historic-boise-cemetery/) and [here](./gerjoii).

[Here](https://focus.boisestate.edu/article/ph-d-in-geophysics/) I talk about how you don't need to know about rocks to do geophysics.
