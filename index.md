# üîµ my thing

I am an applied mathematician interested in [numerical modelling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_simulation), non-linear [inverse problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inverse_problem) & [optimization methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_optimization). My main focus is developing new high-resolution [exploration-geophysics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploration_geophysics) methods.

I am currently a computational geophysicist at [Seequent](https://www.seequent.com/). Before that I was a post-doc fellow at **Aarhus University** in the [Hydro-Geophysics Group](https://hgg.au.dk/) working on remmediation monitoring, and before that I was a post-doc fellow at **Colorado School of Mines** in the [Geophysics Department](https://cwp.mines.edu/faculty/) working on joint-multiphysics, high-resolution inversions.

I have a Bachelors & [Masters](https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1806&context=etds) in Mathematics, and a [PhD](https://scholarworks.boisestate.edu/td/1642/) in Geophysics. Read more about it in my **[curriculum vitae](./diego_domenzain_cv.pdf)**.

*Broadly, I like making things more efficient and less costly by exploting combinatorial structures and/or discretized continuous spaces.*

## üì° imaging the subsurface

My PhD was about __ground penetrating radar and DC electrical resistivity high resolution joint inversion__ - [code](https://github.com/diegozain/gerjoii), [webpage](./gerjoii)

High-resolution non-invasive electrical methods for imaging the shallow subsurface are beneficial for Humanity. They shed light on subsurface energy resources (i.e. oil, gas, geothermal), monitor CO‚ÇÇ sequestration sites and understand ground-water flow.

## üì∫ media coverage

[Here](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/boise-state-students-search-bodies-old-idaho-pen#stream/0) is a radio interview about finding graves at the [Old Idaho Penitentiary](https://history.idaho.gov/location/old-penitentiary/), which is also covered [here](https://www.boisestate.edu/news/2019/03/05/geophysics-club-works-to-help-solve-mysteries-in-historic-boise-cemetery/) and [here](./gerjoii).

[Here](https://focus.boisestate.edu/article/ph-d-in-geophysics/) I talk about how you don't need to know about rocks to do geophysics.
