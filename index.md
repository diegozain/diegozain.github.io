## My thing

I am interested in applying physics, mathematics and high performance computing for the betterment of humanity and exploration of reality. 

I acquire, analyze and process big volumes of data using math and physics by designing and deploying computational algorithms. I specialize in scientific computing, numerical methods, forward models, inverse problems, imaging methods, geophysics and machine learning.

Previous interests include graph theory, error correcting codes, finite geometries and combinatorics.

## Media coverage

[Here](https://focus.boisestate.edu/article/ph-d-in-geophysics/) I talk about how you don't need to know about rocks to do geophysics.

[Here](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/boise-state-students-search-bodies-old-idaho-pen#stream/0) is a radio interview about finding graves at the Idaho _wild_ _west_ Penitentiary, which is also covered [here](https://www.boisestate.edu/news/2019/03/05/geophysics-club-works-to-help-solve-mysteries-in-historic-boise-cemetery/).
