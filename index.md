## My thing

I am interested in applying physics, mathematics and high performance computing for the betterment of humanity and exploration of reality. 

I acquire, analyze and process big volumes of data using math and physics by designing and deploying computational algorithms. I specialize in scientific computing, numerical methods, forward models, inverse problems, imaging methods, geophysics and machine learning.

Previous interests include graph theory, error correcting codes, finite geometries and combinatorics. You can find that [here.](https://digitalcommons.mtu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1806&context=etds)

## My PhD

## Media coverage

[Here](https://www.boisestatepublicradio.org/post/boise-state-students-search-bodies-old-idaho-pen#stream/0) is a radio interview about finding graves at the [Old Idaho Penitentiary](https://history.idaho.gov/location/old-penitentiary/), which is also covered [here](https://www.boisestate.edu/news/2019/03/05/geophysics-club-works-to-help-solve-mysteries-in-historic-boise-cemetery/).

[Here](https://focus.boisestate.edu/article/ph-d-in-geophysics/) I talk about how you don't need to know about rocks to do geophysics.
