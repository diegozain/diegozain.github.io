[code!](https://github.com/diegozain)

I am interested in applying physics, mathematics and high performance computing for the betterment of humanity and exploration of reality. 

I acquire, analyze and process big volumes of data using math and physics by designing and deploying computational algorithms. I specialize in scientific computing, numerical methods, forward models, inverse problems, imaging methods, geophysics and machine learning.

Previous interests include graph theory, error correcting codes, finite geometries and combinatorics.
