## about me

You can find my resume [here](https://github.com/diegozain/cv-resume/blob/master/resume.pdf) and my CV [here](https://github.com/diegozain/cv-resume/blob/master/diego-cv.pdf).

[Here](https://github.com/diegozain/posters?files1) are posters from previous conferences.

My email is diegodomenzain@u.boisestate.edu

I used to make [cool videos](https://vimeo.com/muantariclo). Buñuel would be proud, Dalí would be jealous.
