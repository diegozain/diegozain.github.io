## About me

You can find my resume **[here](./resume.pdf)** and my CV **[here](./diego-cv.pdf)**.

[Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/diego-domenzain-67431171/) & [GoogleScholar](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=tve8X08AAAAJ&hl). My email is _domenzain.diego@gmail.com_.

[Here](https://github.com/diegozain/posters?files=1) are posters from previous conferences.

I used to make [cool videos](https://vimeo.com/muantariclo) too. Buñuel would be proud, Dalí would be jealous.
